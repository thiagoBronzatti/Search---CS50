# Search---CS50

Exercise from Harvard Business School - Web Programming in HTML, CSS, Python and Java Script.

I'm describing with all details on Youtube https://youtu.be/eiN8cEUNz8k 

Google Search : https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/0/search/#how-to-submit

00:00 Search CS50

00:25 Three pages: one for regular Google Search (which must be called index.html), one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.

01:03 On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.

01:48 On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.

02:12 On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)

03:07 Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned.


03:38 Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.


04:22 The CSS you write should resemble Google’s own aesthetics.
